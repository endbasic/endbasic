    Type HELP for interactive usage information.

Output from HELP:

    This is EndBASIC 0.1.0.

    CLEAR    Clears all variables to restore initial state.
    EDIT     Edits the stored program.
    HELP     Prints interactive help.
    INPUT    Obtains user input from the console.
    LIST     Lists the contents of the stored program.
    NEW      Clears the stored program from memory.
    PRINT    Prints a message to the console.
    RENUM    Reassigns line numbers to make them all multiples of ten.
    RUN      Runs the stored program.

    Type HELP followed by a command name for details on that command.
    Press CTRL+D to exit.

Output from HELP CLEAR:

    CLEAR

    Clears all variables to restore initial state.

Output from HELP EDIT:

    EDIT [lineno%]

    Edits the stored program.

    Without a line number, starts interactive editing at the last line of the stored program (or the first line if there is no program yet).  Editing ends on the first empty line.

    With a line number, and if the line does not yet exist, enters interactive editing for that line only.  Otherwise, if the line already exists, presents the contents of that line for interactive editing.  Editing terminates upon an ENTER key press.

Output from HELP HELP:

    HELP [commandname]

    Prints interactive help.

    Without arguments, shows a summary of all available commands.

    With a single argument, shows detailed information about the given command.

Output from HELP INPUT:

    INPUT ["prompt"] <;|,> variableref

    Obtains user input from the console.

    The first expression to this function must be empty or evaluate to a string, and specifies the prompt to print.  If this first argument is followed by the short `;` separator, the prompt is extended with a question mark.

    The second expression to this function must be a bare variable reference and indicates the variable to update with the obtained input.

Output from HELP LIST:

    LIST

    Lists the contents of the stored program.

Output from HELP NEW:

    NEW

    Clears the stored program from memory.

Output from HELP PRINT:

    PRINT [expr1 [<;|,> .. exprN]]

    Prints a message to the console.

    The expressions given as arguments are all evaluated and converted to strings.  Arguments separated by the short `;` separator are concatenated with a single space, while arguments separated by the long `,` separator are concatenated with a tab character.

Output from HELP RENUM:

    RENUM

    Reassigns line numbers to make them all multiples of ten.

Output from HELP RUN:

    RUN

    Runs the stored program.

    Note that the program runs in the context of the interpreter so it will pick up any variables and other state that may already be set.
