EndBASIC is an interpreter for a BASIC-like language and is inspired by
Amstrad's Locomotive BASIC 1.1 and Microsoft's QuickBASIC 4.5.  Like the former,
EndBASIC intends to provide an interactive environment that seamlessly merges
coding with immediate visual feedback.  Like the latter, EndBASIC offers
higher-level programming constructs and strong typing.

EndBASIC offers a simplified and restricted environment to learn the foundations
of programming and focuses on features that can quickly reward the programmer.
These features include things like a built-in text editor, commands to
render graphics, and commands to interact with the hardware of a Raspberry
Pi.  Implementing this kind of features has priority over others such as
performance or a much richer language.

EndBASIC is written in Rust and runs both on the web and locally on a variety of
operating systems and platforms, including macOS, Windows, and Linux.

EndBASIC is free software under the [Apache 2.0 License](LICENSE).

## What's in this crate?

`endbasic-core` provides the language parser and interpreter.  By design, this
crate provides zero commands and zero functions.

## Language features

EndBASIC's language features are inspired by other BASIC interpreters but the
language does not intend to be fully compatible with them.  The language
currently supports:

*   Variable types: boolean (`?`), double (`#`), integer (`%`), and string
    (`$`).
*   Strong typing with optional variable type annotations.
*   `DATA` statements for literal primitive values.  Booleans, numbers, and
    strings are supported, but strings must be double-quoted.
*   `IF ... THEN` / `ELSEIF ... THEN` / `ELSE` / `END IF` statements.
*   `FOR x = ... TO ... [STEP ...]` / `NEXT` loops.
*   `GOSUB @label` / `RETURN` for procedure execution.
*   `GOTO @label` statements and `@label` annotations.
*   `WHILE ...` / `WEND` loops.
*   UTF-8 everywhere (I think).

## Design principles

Some highlights about the EndBASIC implementation are:

*   Minimalist core.  The interpreter knows how to execute the logic of the
    language but, by default, it exposes no builtins to the scriptsâ€”not even
    `INPUT` or `PRINT`.  This makes EndBASIC ideal for embedding into other
    programs, as it is possible to execute external code without side-effects or
    by precisely controlling how such code interacts with the host program.

*   Async support.  The interpreter is async-compatible, making it trivial to
    embed it into Javascript via WASM.

## Examples

The `examples` directory contains sample code to show how to embed the EndBASIC
interpreter into your own programs.  In particular:

*   [`examples/config.rs`](examples/config.rs): Shows how to instantiate a
    minimal EndBASIC interpreter and uses it to implement what could be a
    configuration file parser.

*   [`examples/dsl.rs`](example/dsl.rs): Shows how to instantiate an EndBASIC
    interpreter with custom functions and commands to construct what could be a
    domain-specific language.  This language is then used to control some
    hypothetical hardware lights and exemplifies how to bridge the Rust world
    and the EndBASIC world.
