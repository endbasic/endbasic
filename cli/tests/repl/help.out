Output from HELP CLEAR:

    CLEAR

    Clears all variables to restore initial state.

Output from HELP CLS:

    CLS

    Clears the screen.

Output from HELP COLOR:

    COLOR [fg%][, bg%]

    Sets the foreground, the background, or both colors.

    Color numbers are given as ANSI numbers and can be between 0 and 255.  If a color number is not specified, then the color is left unchanged.

Output from HELP DIR:

    DIR

    Displays the list of files on disk.

Output from HELP EDIT:

    EDIT [lineno%]

    Edits the stored program.

    Without a line number, starts interactive editing at the last line of the stored program (or the first line if there is no program yet).  Editing ends on the first empty line.

    With a line number, and if the line does not yet exist, enters interactive editing for that line only.  Otherwise, if the line already exists, presents the contents of that line for interactive editing.  Editing terminates upon an ENTER key press.

Output from HELP EXIT:

    EXIT [code%]

    Exits the interpreter.

    The optional code indicates the return value to return to the system.

Output from HELP HELP:

    HELP [commandname]

    Prints interactive help.

    Without arguments, shows a summary of all available commands.

    With a single argument, shows detailed information about the given command.

Output from HELP INPUT:

    INPUT ["prompt"] <;|,> variableref

    Obtains user input from the console.

    The first expression to this function must be empty or evaluate to a string, and specifies the prompt to print.  If this first argument is followed by the short `;` separator, the prompt is extended with a question mark.

    The second expression to this function must be a bare variable reference and indicates the variable to update with the obtained input.

Output from HELP LIST:

    LIST

    Lists the contents of the stored program.

Output from HELP LOAD:

    LOAD filename

    Loads the given program.

    The filename must be a string and must be a basename (no directory components).  The .BAS extension is optional, but if present, it must be .BAS.

Output from HELP LOCATE:

    LOCATE row%, column%

    Moves the cursor to the given position.

Output from HELP NEW:

    NEW

    Clears the stored program from memory.

Output from HELP PRINT:

    PRINT [expr1 [<;|,> .. exprN]]

    Prints a message to the console.

    The expressions given as arguments are all evaluated and converted to strings.  Arguments separated by the short `;` separator are concatenated with a single space, while arguments separated by the long `,` separator are concatenated with a tab character.

Output from HELP RENUM:

    RENUM

    Reassigns line numbers to make them all multiples of ten.

Output from HELP RUN:

    RUN

    Runs the stored program.

    Note that the program runs in the context of the interpreter so it will pick up any variables and other state that may already be set.

Output from HELP SAVE:

    SAVE filename

    Saves the current program in memory to the given filename.

    The filename must be a string and must be a basename (no directory components).  The .BAS extension is optional, but if present, it must be .BAS.
