 EndBASIC tour: Welcome!
=========================
[39m[49m
Welcome to the EndBASIC tour demo program.  I'm glad you have made it this far!

EndBASIC is an interpreter for a BASIC-like language and is inspired by
Amstrad's Locomotive BASIC 1.1 and Microsoft's QuickBASIC 4.5.  The main idea
behind EndBASIC is to provide a playground for learning the foundations of
programming in a simplified environment.

EndBASIC is written in Rust and is proven to work on Linux, macOS and Windows.
It likely works on other Unix systems too.  And, thanks to WASM, it also runs
on the web--which I bet is how you are reading this right now.

If you are accessing EndBASIC via the web interface, please be aware that
this interface is highly experimental and has many rough edges.  In particular,
things will go wrong if you try to resize the browser window.  Just reload
the page for a "reboot".

[38;5;9m[49mWhen not in the tour, use the HELP command to access the interactive help
system.

Without further ado, let's get started!

 EndBASIC tour: The basics
===========================
[39m[49m
There are four primitive types:

* Booleans (?): Literals TRUE and FALSE.
* Double-precision floating point (#): Literals must contain a period.
* 32-bit integers (%): Literals must not contain a period.
* Strings ($): Literals are double-quoted.

Type annotations are optional when the type can be deduced.  The only time
when they are required is when defining new variables via INPUT.
There are no type promotions (not even between integers and doubles).

A trivial program to ask a question and print an answer would look like:

    INPUT "What is your name"; name$
    PRINT "Hello,"; name$

Expressions work as you would expect, with the usual operator precedence
rules.  Expressions can take function calls too, but I'll let you find what
those are via HELP.

There are no line numbers and no plans to add them... so, sorry, no GOTO!

 EndBASIC tour: Control flow
=============================
[39m[49m
Fully-specified if statements look like this:

    IF a% = 1 THEN
        PRINT "a is 1"
    ELSEIF a% <> 2 THEN
        PRINT "a is not 2"
    ELSE
        PRINT "a is something else"
    END IF

While loops look like this:

    WHILE a% < 10
        a% = a% + 1
    WEND

For loops look like this:

    FOR a = 1 TO 10 STEP 2
        PRINT a
    NEXT

 EndBASIC tour: File manipulation
==================================
[39m[49m
Given that you are reading this tour, you have already encountered how to
load a program and run it.  But here is how you'd go about creating a new
program from scratch:

1. Type NEW to clear the machine's program and variables.
2. Type EDIT to enter the full-screen editor.
3. Type your program in the editor and then press ESC to exit.
4. Optionally save your program with SAVE "some-name.bas".
5. Run the program with RUN.
6. Repeat from 2 if things don't go as planned.

The cycle above works for demos too.  You can LOAD any demo program and
enter the interactive editor with EDIT to see and modify its code.  What
you cannot do is save them under their original name; you will have to pick
a different name.

If you are in the browser, rest assured that all programs are stored in
your browser's local storage.  Nothing goes to the cloud.

 EndBASIC tour: Screen manipulation
====================================
[39m[49m
You have several commands at your disposal to manipulate the contents of
the screen.  Visual features are particularly interesting for teaching
purposes, so expect more in this regard.

For example, we can print the foundational colors by selecting them with
the "COLOR" command and positioning the cursor with "LOCATE":

[12;5H[38;5;0m[49mThis is color 0
[13;5H[38;5;1m[49mThis is color 1
[14;5H[38;5;2m[49mThis is color 2
[15;5H[38;5;3m[49mThis is color 3
[16;5H[38;5;4m[49mThis is color 4

And that's it for the tour.  You can now type EDIT to see the code that
took you over this journey, load other demo files or... just go forth and
explore.  HELP and DIR are your friends at any point.
